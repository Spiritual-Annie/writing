# Rise! How to Spiritually Transform Experiences and Become a Riser

My life began with challenges that most people's don't, and some can't bring themselves to believe exist in America, much less for me  survive and transform into a larger perspective that has led to a deep sense of spirituality and hope for humanity. But, that is precisely what my life and this book are all about.

In as small a nutshell as I'm able, an overview is needed here. My father is extremely mentally ill, so much so that he feared being diagnosed and so never sought help. He successfully hid his illnesses, or they hadn't fully developed, until after his marriage to my mother, which was expected. Both being raised in ultraconservative Roman Catholic families in the same parish and parochial schools, they believed in the traditional roles of husband and wife prevalent in the 1940's and in large families.

By the time I was born as the 6th of their 7 children some 12 years later, my father's bipolar disorder and narcissism had taken hold, and my mother had become a functional alcoholic. My birth, in 1959, had its difficulties, the main one being that my feet had hooked on my mother's pelvis while I was turning for birth, causing defects in my legs.
